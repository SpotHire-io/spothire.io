# SpotHire Prototyping

Based on [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run:

* `yarn install` (first run only)
* `yarn start`
* `yarn run build-css`
* `yarn run storybook`

Load <http://localhost:9009/> to see the storybook (pattern/component library),
or <http://localhost:3000/> to see the app itself, once weâ€™re working on it.
